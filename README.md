# 🎧 Minimalist Music Player (React Native / Expo)

## Overview
A minimalist music player built with React Native, designed to help users enjoy the music already stored on their device. 
The app lists local tracks, plays them with smooth controls, and continues playback in the background so users can carry their soundtrack anywhere.

This project focuses on a clean, distraction-free experience — no accounts, no streaming, just music.
